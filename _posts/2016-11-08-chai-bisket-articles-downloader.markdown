description: Chrome Extension to download your favourite articles from Chai Bisket. 
---

I want to make this blog short. Being a regular follower of Chai-Bisket I always want to have the offline copy of their articles.

Initially I thought of writing a python script to download them but later changed my mind and made a chrome extension which creates a "Download" button in the articles.
